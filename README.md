# mole-game
mole game from the boot camp at frontend masters 

## Instruction
Feed the hungry mole and make them happy, please! 
Don't miss when they come up the hole and have their mouth open. 

It is a perfect chance for you to feed them before they turn around and show their fluffy tail.

## Programming language
`JavaScript`: practice data structure 

`HTML`: simply structured HTML using `<div>` to divide each space for moles. 

`CSS`: practice different versions of the mole's mood, and cursors.
