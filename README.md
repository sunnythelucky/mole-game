# mole-game
mole game from the bootcamp at frontend masters 

<h2>Instruction</h2>
<p>Feed the hungry mole and make them happy, please! <br/>

It is a perfect chance for you to feed them before they turn around and show their fluffy tail.</p>

<h2>Programming language</h2>
`JavaScript` : practice data structure <br/>
`HTML` : simply structured HTML using '<div>' to divide each spaces for moles. <br/>
